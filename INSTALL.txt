Installation
============

Requirements
------------

The `texdef` program is a Perl script which needs a Perl interpreter to work.
Informations about installing Perl can be found at http://www.perl.org/get.html.

The script calls a TeX compiler (tex, latex, ...) to display the definition of commands/macros.
Therefore (La)TeX must also be installed.
Informations about installing (La)TeX can be found at http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html.


Location
--------

For installation the script 'texdef.pl' must simply be copied to a location suitable for executables,
i.e. a directory in the PATHi, e.g. '/usr/bin' or '/usr/local/bin' for Linux/Unix.

The script should be set as "executable", i.e. 'chmod +x texdef.pl' for Linux/Unix.
This is not required for MS Windows.


Name
----

This script can show the definitions of commands with different flavours of TeX
(tex, etex, latex, pdftex, pdfetex, pdflatex, xetex, xelatex, context, ...).
The flavour can be given using an command line option or over the _script name_,
i.e. if the script is called 'texdef' it will use 'tex', but called 'latexdef'
it will use 'latex' and so on.  
The script can be simply copied several times, but creating _symbolic links_
to the real script is enough on operation systems / file systems which support
this.

At least the two variations 'texdef' and 'latexdef' should be installed.


Quick Install Nodes for Linux/Unix
----------------------------------

    cp texdef.pl /usr/local/bin/
    cd /usr/local/bin
    ln -s texdef.pl texdef
    ln -s texdef.pl latexdef
    ln -s texdef.pl etexdef
    ln -s texdef.pl luatexdef
    ln -s texdef.pl lualatexdef
    ln -s texdef.pl pdftexdef
    ln -s texdef.pl pdflatexdef
    ln -s texdef.pl xetexdef
    ln -s texdef.pl xelatexdef
    ln -s texdef.pl 'some other TeX flavour of your choice'

or use the Makefile (defaults to `/usr/local/bin`)

    make install INSTALLDIR=/your/path
